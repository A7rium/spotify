# Math Extensions Reference Implementation

The reference implementation is meant to be a line-by-line transcription of the specification from ECMASpeak into JavaScript, as much as is possible.

Its purpose is to provide a 100%-fidelity implementation to run tests against in order to check the spec logic. In particular, it is not intended be a usable implementation or polyfill.
